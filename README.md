This is a repository for our Applied Physics 184 project modeling a train station using Arduino. 
The model features a toll system simulating the beep™️ Card system.
A fire alert system was also implemented to send a text message when fire is detected.
The model also has an LCD to display some messages (e.g., the train is approaching).

Special thanks to our professors Dr. Elmer Estacio and Dr. Maricor Soriano for teaching us the theoretical building blocks that we applied in the project.
We would also like to thank our laboratory instructors Sir Mark Jeremy Narag and Sir Rene Principe for creating an engaging and educational environment in the laboratory.
We would like to give a shoutout to Sir Vince Paul Juguilon and Sir Kenneth Leo for letting us sit-in during their Wednesday classes to make up for some activities.

This is a project by Ma. Ezthelia Kaye Camit, Mark Joseph William D. Ducusin, and Edneil Soriano Jr.
